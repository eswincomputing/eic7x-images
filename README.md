# Introduction
This repository will only be used to release system image files for the EIC7x series chips, and the corresponding source code will not be uploaded for the time being. In future versions, we will provide source code links and documentation links for each release version.

# Download
Since the system images we upload are all over 1GB and cannot be uploaded directly, please go to the release page to download. You can download from releases page:https://github.com/eswincomputing/eic7x-images/releases
